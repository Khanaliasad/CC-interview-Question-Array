##Interview Question about Array
####Which I failed

#Senario:
Consider Two Players
player 1 & player 2 have an array as scoreboard and every time someone Scores the array appends the player code in the array

player code is
{
player 1 : "1",
player 2 : "2",
}
array example
let test1 = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2];
let test2 = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2];
let test3 = [1, 2, 2, 1];

calculate which player won the most by displaying the player code and calculating most number of wins

let test1 = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]; //player 1 , 3 wins
let test2 = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]; // player 2 , 5 wins
let test3 = [1, 2, 2, 1]; //tie , 2 wins

// above is the test Data
